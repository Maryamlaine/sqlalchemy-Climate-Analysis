# sqlalchemy-Climate Analysis
We used Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis (precipitation, max, min temperature) and data exploration of a climate database. The analysis was completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries to connect to sqlite database, Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualizations and ultimately used Flask app to deploy the results.
